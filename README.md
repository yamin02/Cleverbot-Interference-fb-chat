# Cleverbot-Interference-fb-chat
This is an interference between the open source AI bot "clever bot" and any users facebook messenger chats. 

The code requires gecko driver and firefox browser installed in your host machine 

How it works ?
- The code first connects with your facebook profile messenger id. 
- You input the person namre you want to chat
- The code reads the thread Id of that chat and initalizes the message 
- The code then inputs the last message in the cleverbot "https://www.cleverbot.com/" website in firefox using gecko driver
- The cleverbot replies an answer and then the program retrieves it 
- The program then prints it in your facebook chat as reply .

Note : Frequent use of the program may compel facebook to block your profile as it may identify it as a bot .
